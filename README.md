A Rock Paper Scissors type game. To run this program outside of an IDE, use the following commands from the project directory:

1. mvn clean install
2. java -cp target/ggs-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar com.drem.games.ggs.App

##Rules
* Everyone starts with zero bullets. This is to weed out the people who arenâ€™t paying attention to the rules. The logical first move of every game is to Reload.
* The objective is to shoot the opponent while they are vulnerable.
    * **If you shoot with no bullets, you are vulnerable.** 
    * **If your shield has taken too much damage, you are vulnerable.**
    * **If you are reloading, you are vulnerable.**
* In case of a stalemate, the person with the most bullets wins. If both players have the same amount of bullets, the game is a draw.

##Actions
* Block - Shield takes one damage if the opponent has shot a bullet.
* Shoot - Shoot a bullet if you have any. If not, you are vulnerable. 
* Reload - Gives you one bullet. If the opponent shoots, you are dead.

##Single Player
* Currently there is only one difficulty. The computer player will (semi)randomly make a move. Best of luck!

##Multi Player
###Host a game
   * Provide an opponent with the code given on the screen and let the battle begin! 
   * The session will stay open for one minute. If no other player has joined, go find something else to do.

###Joing a game
   * Enter the code provided by your opponent. 
   * If the game can not be found, you're better off playing single player. Or just try again, I don't care.

##Guns
* Pistol(1)
* Shotgun(3)
* Machine Gun(5)
* Rocket Launcher(10)

##Requirements
To run this project, you will need to be running Java 1.8. Currently there are no dependencies on Java 1.8, but this may change in the future. To build this game from the source code, you will also need Maven. Once you have these two things, you cant build the project from scratch and start gaming!
