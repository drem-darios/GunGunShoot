##Rules
* Everyone starts with zero bullets. This is to weed out the people who arenâ€™t paying attention to the rules. The logical first move of every game is to Reload.
* The objective is to shoot the opponent while they are vulnerable.
    * **If you shoot with no bullets, you are vulnerable.** 
    * **If your shield has taken too much damage, you are vulnerable.**
    * **If you are reloading, you are vulnerable.**
* In case of a stalemate, the person with the most bullets wins. If both players have the same amount of bullets, the game is a draw.

##Game Modes
* Single Player - Play against the computer! Select a difficulty and see if you have what it takes to outsmart the computer player.
* Multiplayer - Host a local game, or join a public game for some head-to-head action!

##Actions
